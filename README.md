# GenCyber
I am a K-12 education leader with over 25 years of experience across the United States. As a digital support specialist, I love to nerd out on tech, STEMTok, code, drones, robotics, and nature. I’m a positive, eager, and slightly crazy learner who thrives on exploring new ideas and inspiring others.

Passionate about building visual content that is funny, engaging, bright, and timely, I enjoy making learning fun and accessible for everyone. Connect with me on LinkedIn, follow my adventures on TikTok, subscribe to my YouTube, and check out my projects on GitHub!

Let’s build, learn, and laugh together.
